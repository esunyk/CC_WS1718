done so far:
- read up on recursive descent parsers
- read up on regular expressions
- get a feeeling for go (tour, spec, write own simple programs)
- get started on grammar without consideration for purpose
- correct grammar for recursive descent parsing


grammar outline:
simplest program -> top-level declarations, variables, function calls -> expressions
-> all operators, keywords, line comments, ... (simple tokens)
-> pocket calculator -> String -> include statement
-> ...

problems encountered:
-start at root or with something simple -> both, leave complicated things for later but create structure
-productions: all alternatives at once or everything simple? -> all at once for better productions
-how much at once? -> not more than 3, 4 new things 
-entry point "main" function: syntactic or semantic? -> can be syntactic, easier to handle semantically (grammar not changed to reflect it yet)
-at least one function among TLD: syntactic or semantic?
